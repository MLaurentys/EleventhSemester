      <h3>NOTEWORTHY:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use of bulma for almost all layout classes, guaranteeing mobile
          friendlyness. All the additional layout style is in default-styles and
          is tested to be mobile friendly as well. Font and sizing styles are
          found in shadow doms.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you load the app page, it is very likely that you will bump into
          cards without an image. I could remove those, but that would break the
          game in some cases, making it impossible to reach target.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game is beatable in most cases, but cases it is not are not
          handled.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is support for choosing start and end points to provide
          customized play, but also to test the use of localStorage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The options part of the app is loaded in a single request... I could
          not find a way to paginate the request.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Grading: (I will list discounts and bonus I find correct)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Interface looks "amateurish" or like GIF Finder HW (-10. When no image
          is found card position becomes a bit off)
        </li>
        <li>
          Code shows errors in console (-0: There is one error. It is generated
          by loading a random id that is not found in the database. The program
          recovers from it by loading an additional random id. That seems
          unavoidable on firefox. I do not believe it is possible to prevent
          fetch 404 errors from displaying.)
        </li>
        <li>
          App functionality and programming goes beyond what we did in class
          (+10)
        </li>
        <li>App is "portfolio quality" (or nearly so) (+5)</li>
        <li>
          There are CSS validation erros, but they are from bulma package.
        </li>
        <li>
          I met the expected goals and some of mine. However, I do see much room
          for improvement still.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TODO:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Favorites page: should load images and have path being displayed with
          images. This should not be a problem at all.
        </li>
        <li>Add moving parts to pages, mabe some 'hmmm' moving emojis.</li>
        <li>
          Fix button position in the app page. They look too amateur right now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maybe display less images per pagination on mobile. Have it using a
          swiper would be good.
        </li>
