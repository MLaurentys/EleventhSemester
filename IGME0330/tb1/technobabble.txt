Questions:


#1 - What are the 3 distinct layers of a (simple) web browser app? (DO NOT "google" the answer - it's in the video, near the start. It's also in the above notes)

Structure, presentation and behavior are the layers of simple web browser apps.

#2 - What are the 3 languages used to program these layers? (DO NOT "google" the answer - it's in the video, near the start. It's also in the above notes)

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to program the structural, presentational and behavioral layers, respectively.

#3 - List 3 things that "use strict"; does? (see the link in V. Reference below below)

"use strict"; converts some silent errors into throw errors, prevents some cases where mapping the name of a variable to its definition is impossible until runtime and stops some of the possible misuses of arguments and eval.

#4 - Note that we declared the words1, words2, and words3 arrays with const - can elements be added and/or deleted from these arrays?

Yes it is possible to push new elements to const arrays.

#5 - Give an example of following the software development D.R.Y. principle

// BAD
function DoSomething(value) {
	if(!value) {
		WarningFunction();
		value = FunctionToHandleMissingValue();
	}
	...
}
function DoSomethingElse(value) {
	if(!value) {
		WarningFunction();
		value = FunctionToHandleMissingValue();
	}
	...
}

// BETTER
function HandleValueMissing() {
	WarningFunction();
	value = FunctionToHandleMissingValue();
}
function DoSomething(value) {
	if(!value) value = HandleValueMissing();
	...
}
function DoSomethingElse(value) {
	if(!value) value = HandleValueMissing();
	...
}


#6 - Within JavaScript template literals, what goes inside the ${}?

An expression.

#7 - Which symbol does a CSS id selector always start with?

They always starts with '#'.

#8 - Using JS, what are two ways to detect that the page elements (i.e. DOM) have fully loaded?

One way is adding event listers. Idelaly DOMContentLoaded but also readystatechange.
Another way is checking if the value of document.readyState is "complete".

#9 - What does an event handler - ex. myButton.onclick= - "point" at?

The onclick event expects a reference to function. However, you can have it set to other values, which just leads to erratic behavior.

#10 - What do the first two arguments of .addEventListener() represent?

The first is the event targeted, whitch is called event type. The second is the event handler, which can be either an object that implements the EventListener interface or a event lister callback function.
