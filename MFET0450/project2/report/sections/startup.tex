The first requirement for system startup is that emergency stops are reset to their original position. This is a common and necessary procedure. Another requirement to power on the system is having the both the bottles and the liquid feeders with some amount of product.They do not have to be full, but need to be fed to a predefined capacity.

The last requirement is the conveyor to be full. This is a necessity because system supports different types of bottles. If the feeder is fed with a different type of bottle than those in the bottle conveyor, then there would be a big a problem, possibly big, with the output of the system. Once there is a reset, like with a power loss, the system will recover to a safe state by moving everything from the conveyor to a designated overflow area. The same happens when the system is shut off normally: moves shutting off power to the conveyor, objects are, once again, moved to an overflow area.
