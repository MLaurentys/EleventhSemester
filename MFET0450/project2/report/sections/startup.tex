The first requirement for system startup is that emergency stops are reset to their original position. This is a common and necessary procedure. 

The other two startup requirements are the feeder being full and the belts being empty. While the former is not a necessity, the second one is because the system relies on constant speed and timers to calculate the position of products. Once there is a reset, like with a power loss, necessary information is lost and there is no way to recover the position of the product. If not emptied the system would end up moving products to wrong lines, to state of the possibilities.
