The proposed bottle filling system (``System") solves the problem of rinsing, filling and packaging bottles in high speed with low operation cost. When compared to manual processes the advantage is clear in terms of economy but the System also meets more complex business requirements. In a paint manufacture, for example, several colors of paint are produced, bottled and packaged, but each paint cannot get mixed with the others.

Not only that, but typically black and white paint ship in larger bottles, while colored paint sells is smaller containers. The feeder of bottles of such machines must be able to comport containers of different sizes. The feeder of paint must also be able to be filled with different colors of paint. In the case of paint, the feeder must be cleaned so colors do not get mixed whenever the paint is changed.Other liquid have different requirements, such as toxicity removal or cleaning through chemical reactions. See the following graphic of the System:

Bottles flow from the feeder onto the conveyor. Once on the conveyor, the bottles are rinsed and proceed to the liquid filler. Once a predetermined amount of bottles reach the liquid filler, the liquid flows from the liquid feeder to the bottles. After it is filled the bottle must be caped and moved to a predetermined area. The process of moving may involve sorting or could be directly connected to the startup configuration of the feeders. The conveyor part System featured only fills the bottle.
